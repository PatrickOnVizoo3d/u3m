    added:
        - bending to physics (cantilever for horizontal and inclined surface)
        - stretch to physics
        - angle_measurement
        - force_measurement
        - friction to physics

    changed:
        - thickness is now required for physics
        - weight is now required for physics
        - weight got modified to include the geometry of the sample
        - removed optional_mass_per_area_measurement object
