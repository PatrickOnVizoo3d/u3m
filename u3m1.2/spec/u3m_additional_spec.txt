common additional information for all file formats,
specifics for u3m and u3ma can be found in their respective files


FOR ALL FILE FORMATS DESCRIBED HERE:
    - files that do not adhere this specification to the point are malformed
    - malformed files may be rejected upon loading or the user has to be warned about them
    - compatible software must not produce malformed files -> if you encounter a malformed file either reject it upon loading or fix it (but do not damage it further)
    - parts you're not allowed to touch/that are not understand by you (Custom section i'm looking at you) have to be kept unchanged
    - you are not allowed to remove files that are not referenced in the common section
    - you must keep the folder structure
    - a single exception is: stripping
        removing everything NOT referenced in the common sections & removing everything in the custom sections 
        -> this option is only present to allow transfer of files without disclosing unwanted information, and should thus be ONLY BE USED FOR THIS SPECIFIC USECASE,
           not for everyday work, as it might impede with the performance of u3m compliant programs and lead to irreversible information loss
    - software that accesses another company's custom section for any purpose other than making an EXACT copy without that company's consent, is to be considered malformed and broken
    - in case of dispute between examples & spec, the spec wins
    - Relative paths must match the regex specified in the end of this file
    - Never touch or peek into another company's custom section without their permission & them knowing - NEVER EVER, or you'll lock yourself to their releases and changes or make your clients unhappy by breaking compatibility to older/other files
    - Try to avoid referencing external data in your custom section, as someone else may remove that external data - and if you have to, place them in their own file and use a descriptive name (e.g. vizoo_custom/vizoo_custom_extra_data.bin) so no one else drops it/overwrites it accidentally
    - All files referenced in the common section must have an open specification, so if you want to have your data included there, you'll have to specify & open it to everyone

colors:
    - Each compatible software must honor colorprofiles in color images (e.g. basecolor map) and ignore colorprofiles in data images (e.g. normal map)
        => keep the profile in the image, or convert to working color space
        => Standard colorspace is sRGB, D65 10Â° (http://www.color.org/profiles/sRGB2014.icc !MIND THE LICENSE!)
        => If no profile is found but a profile is required use the Standard colorspace defined above
    - all calculations on colors must happen in linear rgb space & are specified for normalized values in the range [0, 1]

recommendations for the custom sections:
    - store them as encrypted base64 encoded string, so no other company can by mistake or evil intention modify your custom data
        - not meant to hold sensitive data, just to prevent unintended access and hinder unfair business tactics
        - gives the owner of the custom section a way to ensure integrity of the stored data
        - gives the owner of the custom section a way to share data with another company without having to share it with everyone
    - your software must handle broken or missing custom data (it may warn the user, but must not reject the file)

recommendations for compatibility:
    - load everything from u3m 1.0 to the newest version of the spec
    - store it as the lowest possible version, e.g. if nothing added in u3m 1.1 is required, save it as u3m 1.0
    - you may warn the user, if any of his/her actions causes an "upgrade" to a later version
    - you may keep the version you loaded, even if the file could be saved in a lower version
    - you may let the user choose a version
    - you should not mix versions, e.g. store u3m 1.0 files in u3ma 1.1

legal:
    - the specifications of all file formats linked in the common section is part of the u3m specification
    - these specifications are put under the same or are more permissible & compatible license then u3m itself (aside from png, tiff, jpeg & json)
